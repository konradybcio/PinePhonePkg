# TODO:
* Nuke dep on .fex
* Figure out a good way to boot reliably?!
* Minimize
* Update ACPI tables

DONT TRY HDMI IT WILL EXPLODE, it relies on an arm32 blob that I neutralized, so it will probably lock up big time.

Based on @imbushuo's NintendoSwitchPkg, mashed together with AW BSP BSD2 drivers. ARM32 UEFI wouldn't be
much useful on the PinePhone. Tested building with edk2@f95cdd316c3d56e8f76b5044be54b9645e1dc60f + patches,
edk2-platforms@325097364dbdbc7b9311c723372e4e36a2f0012e.

For simplefb you probably want to chainload this from p-boot,

</br>

For u-boot chainloading, you can find a sample configuration in theorycrafting/u-boot-config

</br>

For not-chainloaded booting, eh I can't even tell if it boots, no serial cable :(

</br>

Generally once somebody gets this to boot, W10 IoT should be bootable, and so should be W10 itself.

Maybe even W11 22000 builds, as armv8.1 is not yet an enforced requirement.
